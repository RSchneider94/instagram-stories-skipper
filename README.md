## About

If you are a person who has [OCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obsessive%E2%80%93compulsive_disorder) and woke up someday angry or with a lot to do, you might have already experienced the feeling of opening your Instagram and then... FULL OF STORIES!!!11!! But... You can't simply watch them right now. Your desire is to just turn those damn circles "off". So I created this script for you. :heart:

## Running

1. Copy the code from `index.js` file.
2. Open [Instagram Web](https://www.instagram.com/).
3. Log in.
4. Open the Developer Console.
5. Paste the code.
6. Open any story.
7. Start the script running it on console by typing `startProcess()`.
8. Watch the show! :sunglasses:

It stops automatically after all stories were gone!
